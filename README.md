# PyBer Ride Share Analysis
## Overview

On top of the analysis already done (of which the results will also be discussed here), we were tasked with the assignment of looking across all city types and seeing how fares differ from each as well as noticing other trends.
  
## Results

The first part of this assignment was to develop summary statistics for the ride share program by city type. Below is the chart that was developed:

As you can see, there is definitely more participating in urban cities over rural or suburban cities. What is particularly interesting is the driver/ride ratio per city type. As you can clearly see from the data, urban cities have more drivers than rides available. Also, the ratio for rural areas is pretty low at about 58%. This indicates that there is an overflow of drivers in urban cities and a lack of them in rural areas. This is also reflected in the Fare per Driver column, where it is shown that the share of fare per driver in rural areas is high at $55.49, whereas in urban cities it is only $16.57. This indicates that more drivers are needed in rural areas and less drivers are needed in urban areas.

Furthermore, we graphed the Total Weekly Fares per each city type as show nere:

This graph shows that even though the Fare per driver rate is higher for rural cities, they still have a much lower market share than urban cities. This conclusion makes intuitive sense as there are more drivers in urban areas than in rural areas. Interestingly, surburban areas have higher market share towards the end of April. This may indicate that more people went out when the weather was nicer in the spring time. As the graph shows, the market share for suburban cities is relatively close to that of urban cities towards the end of the graph.

## Summary

In conclusion, here are three recommendations we would like to make to PyBer to improve the overall company operations:
  - Increase the amount of drivers in rural areas and advertise the ride share service more to increase not only the availability of services but the amount of business acquired as well. 
  - Increase advertising in urban areas to decrease the driver to ride ratio and because this is the most utilized areas.
  - Examine ride share trends throughout the year to see where riders use service most and optimize that time of year.
